# BedMobile
Bluetooth Enabled Remote Control Bed 
The project is focused on making a remote-controlled hospital bed which is controlled via a phone connected to the bed via Bluetooth. It hopes to empower handicapped patients, making them more self-sufficient so that they do not have to rely on external help for their mobility. 
We used a PIC micro-controller and programmed it in C.
